## How to Use

You'll see a list of all your vocabulary words with the following information:
- **Word**: The English word

- **Meaning**: Vietnamese translation
- **Practice Statistics** (if you've practiced before):

    - 🟢 Green (90-100): Excellent
    - 🟡 Light Green (75-89): Good
    - 🟠 Amber (60-74): Fair
    - 🔴 Red (below 60): Needs improvement

Tap on any word card to start practicing.

### Step 3: Practice Pronunciation
On the pronunciation practice screen:

1. **Read the word**: See the word, phonetic transcription, and meaning
2. **Listen**: Tap the speaker icon 🔊 to hear the correct pronunciation
3. **Record**: Tap the microphone button 🎤 to start recording
4. **Speak**: Say the word clearly into your device's microphone
5. **Stop**: Tap the stop button ⏹️ when finished
6. **Score**: Tap "Score My Pronunciation" to get your results

### Step 4: View Results
After scoring, you'll see:

- **Feedback**: Personalized suggestions to improve

Your score is automatically saved to track your progress.

### Step 5: Continue Practicing
Tap "Chọn từ khác" (Select different word) to return to the word selection screen and practice another word.

## Tips for Best Results

### Pronunciation Tips
- 📱 **Hold device close**: Keep microphone 6-12 inches from your mouth
- 🔇 **Quiet environment**: Reduce background noise
- 🗣️ **Speak clearly**: Pronounce each word distinctly
- ⏱️ **Moderate pace**: Don't rush, speak at normal speed
- 🎯 **Listen first**: Always use the speaker to hear correct pronunciation

### Practice Strategy
1. **Focus on low scores**: Practice words with red/amber scores more frequently
2. **Regular practice**: Short daily sessions are better than long sporadic ones
3. **Track progress**: Watch your average scores improve over time
4. **Difficult words**: Identify words you struggle with and practice them more
5. **Variety**: Practice different types of words (nouns, verbs, etc.)

## Understanding Your Progress

### Practice Count
- Shows how many times you've practiced each word
- Higher count = more practice (but not necessarily better score!)
- Use to identify which words you've been practicing

### Average Score
- Calculated from all your practice attempts for that word
- Updates automatically after each practice session
- Color-coded for quick visual feedback:
  - **Green**: You've mastered this word! Keep it up.
  - **Light Green**: Good pronunciation, minor improvements possible
  - **Amber**: Fair pronunciation, needs more practice
  - **Red**: Needs significant improvement, practice more

### No Statistics Yet?
If you haven't practiced a word yet, you'll only see the word information without practice count or average score. Start practicing to build your statistics!

## Troubleshooting

### Microphone Not Working
1. Check app permissions in device settings
2. Ensure no other app is using the microphone
3. Restart the app
4. Check that microphone is not blocked or covered

### Poor Recognition Accuracy
1. Speak more slowly and clearly
2. Reduce background noise
3. Hold device closer (but not too close)
4. Make sure you're speaking English, not Vietnamese
5. Try practicing with easier words first

### No Vocabulary to Practice
If you see "Chưa có từ vựng" (No vocabulary yet):
1. Go to "🔍 Tra từ" (Search) to look up new words
2. Save words to your vocabulary
3. Return to pronunciation practice

### Scores Seem Inaccurate
- AI scoring is approximate and focuses on general pronunciation
- Some words may be harder to recognize than others
- Multiple practices will give you a better average
- Use feedback to understand specific mistakes

## Privacy & Data

### What Gets Saved
- Word ID and word text
- Your spoken text (from speech recognition)
- Score and similarity rating
- Timestamp of practice session

### What Doesn't Get Saved
- Audio recordings (not stored)
- Personal information
- Your voice data (only text from recognition)

All data is stored locally on your device in the app's database.
